        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>If I had to tell you who I am in three words I will choose these: honest, creative and dedicated. I love art and science, and I believe that when our work is filled with passion that's when great ideas are born. I started to learn web development so I can build something out of nothing. Being a web developer is being analytical, creative and understanding. And I aspire to be all those things.</p>
